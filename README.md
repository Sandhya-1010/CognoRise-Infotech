DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP


TASK 1

IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

• The Iris flower dataset encompasses three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and
virginica.
• These species are discernible through specific measurements. Imagine possessing
measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their distinct species.
• The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of learning from these
measurements and proficiently categorizing Iris flowers into their corresponding
species.
• Employ the Iris dataset to construct a model adept at classifying Iris flowers into
distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
• This dataset serves as a prevalent choice for initial classification tasks, making it
ideal for introductory learning experiences.


TASK 2

TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

• Utilize the Titanic dataset to construct a predictive model determining if a
passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
• This project serves as an introductory exercise, offering accessible data for analysis.
• The dataset comprises passenger details encompassing age, gender, ticket class,
fare, cabin, and survival outcome.
• By applying this data, you can embark on a classic project that provides insights
into survival patterns among Titanic passengers.


TASK 3

FAKE NEWS PREDICTION

• The Fake News Prediction Dataset features both real and fake news, providing a
basis for predictive modeling to identify misinformation. With columns including
Title, Text, and Label (Fake or Real), it addresses the pervasive issue of false or
misleading information in news.
• The dataset supports efforts to enhance information integrity, combat fake news,
and promote media literacy.
